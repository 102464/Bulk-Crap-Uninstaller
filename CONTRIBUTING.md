# How to file a bug report
Create a new issue with as much description of the problem as possible. Include steps needed for reproduction if the bug is not obvious.
It's also possible to submit bug reports anonymously to my [feedback form](http://klocmansoftware.weebly.com/feedback--contact.html).

# How to suggest a new feature
The same as bug report. Well-explained suggestions are preferred.

# How to set up your environment and run tests
Any modern version of Visual Studio should work. You might need to download [this library](https://sourceforge.net/p/kloctoolslibrary/) separately. 
Tests use the test framework included in new Visual Studio versions. Some of the tests require running as 64bit to pass, or some specific applications to be installed.

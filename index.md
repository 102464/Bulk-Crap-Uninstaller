Bulk Crap Uninstaller (or BCUninstaller) is a free (as in speech) program uninstaller. It excels at removing large amounts of applications with minimal user input. It can clean up leftovers, detect orphaned applications, run uninstallers according to premade lists, and much more! Even though BCU was made with IT pros in mind, by default it is so straight-forward that anyone can use it.

BCU can detect and automaticaly uninstall Universal Windows Platform apps (formerly Windows Store Apps), Steam and Oculus store apps, Chocolatey packages, Windows Features and Updates, and many more. It has special support for many uninstalling systems (most notably NSIS, InnoSetup and Msiexec) that allows automatic uninstall using the official uninstaller, even though it's not supported by default. Check below for a full list of functions.

Bulk Crap Uninstaller is licensed under Apache 2.0 open source license, and can be used in both private and commercial settings for free and with no obligations, as long as no conditions of the license are broken.

# What is Bulk Crap Uninstaller? 
**Bulk Crap Uninstaller** (in short **BCUninstaller** or **BCU**) is a free (as in speech *and* beer) bulk program uninstaller with advanced automation. It excels at removing large amounts of applications with minimal to no user input, _while requiring next to no technical knowledge_.

It can detect most applications and games (even portable or not registered), clean up leftovers, force uninstall, automatically uninstall according to premade lists, and much more.

## Detect, manage and quietly uninstall
* Normal registered applications (same as Programs and Features and many other uninstallers)

* Chocolatey packages
* Oculus games/apps
* Steam games/apps
* Windows Features
* Windows Store apps (Universal Windows Platform apps)
* Windows Updates

## Fast, automatic uninstall
* Uninstall any number of applications in a single batch
* Minimal to no user input is required during uninstallation

* Can handle crashing and hanging uninstallers

## Other features

* Huge amount of data about applications is collected and displayed. User can freely browse, filter and export everything
* Filtering with common presets or based on fully custom rules with Regex support
* Verification of uninstaller certificates
* Large amount of configurability
* Can run user-specified commands before and after uninstalling
* Can run on .Net 4.0 or newer, or, if not available, on .Net 3.5 with reduced functionality (will work on Windows 7 or newer with no updates installed)
* Fully portable, settings are saved to a single file

BCU is translated to Arabic, Czech, Dutch, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil and Portugal), Russian, Slovenian and Spanish at the moment of writing this. More to come!

# System requirements
* OS: Windows Vista or newer is recommended. BCU will also work on XP and 2003 with reduced functionality and possibly some bugs. Both 32bit and 64bit versions are supported.
* .NET: Recommended .NET 4.0 or newer, can run on only .NET 3.5 with reduced functionality.
* RAM: Around 300MB or more of free RAM.
* CPU: Doesn't really matter.
* Free space: 40MB or more (most of it is for temporary update files).
* 7200RPM HDD or better is recommended or scan times can get very long depending on configuration. (not as bad in v4.1 thanks to caching)
